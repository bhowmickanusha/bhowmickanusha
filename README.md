- 👋 Hi, I’m Anusha
- 👀 I’m interested in Internet of Things
- 🌱 I’m currently learning AWS IoT and Node-Red (very slowww)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a project that uses the power of the Cloud and big data from sensors, using which something new, unique and exciting can be created
- 💞️ If you wanna do something creative with tech, pls pls pls ask me _/\_
- 📫 reach me at anushabhowmick@ymail.com
- I do a lot of projects...in my head.
- The ones that end up here as repositories (actually get finished from start to end) are because of deadlines, peer pressure, and to avoid embarassment in front of the jury.
